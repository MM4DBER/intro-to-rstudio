Mixture Modeling for Discipline Based Education Researchers (MM4DBER) is an NSF funded training grant to support STEM Education scholars in integrating mixture modeling into their research.

-   Please [visit our website](https://mm4dbers.education.ucsb.edu/) to learn more and apply for the year-long fellowship.

-   Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mm4dbers)!

# Introduction to R and RStudio

This walkthrough is presented by the MM4DBER team and will go through some common tasks carried out in R.
There are many free resources available to get started with R and RStudio.
One of our favorites is [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PART 1: Installation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Install: R, RStudio, and Mplus

**Install R/Rstudio**: [Here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) you will find a guide to installing both R and R Studio.

**Install Mplus**: To install the Mplus software go to their website [here](https://www.statmodel.com/orderonline/).

*Note*: The installation of Mplus requires a paid license with the mixture add-on.
IMMERSE fellows will be given their own copy of Mplus for use during the one year training.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PART 2: Set-up

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 1: Create a new R-project in RStudio

R-projects help us organize our folders , filepaths, and scripts.
To create a new R project:

-   File --\> New Project...

Click "New Directory" --\> New Project --\> Name your project

### Step 2: Create an R-markdown document

An R-markdown file provides an authoring framework for data science that allows us to organize our reports using texts and code chunks.
This document you are reading was made using R-markdown!

To create an R-markdown:

-   File --\> New File --\> R Markdown...

In the window that pops up, give the R-markdown a title such as "**Introduction to R and RStudio**" Click "OK." You should see a new markdown with some example text and code chunks.
We want a clean document to start off with so delete everything from line 10 down.
Go ahead and save this document in your R Project folder.

### Step 3: Load packages

Your first code chunk in any given markdown should be the packages you will be using.
To insert a code chunk, etiher use the keyboard shortcut ctrl + alt + i or Code --\> Insert Chunk or click the green box with the letter C on it.
There are a few packages we want our markdown to read in:

```{r}
library(psych)     # describe()
library(here)      # helps with specifying file paths
library(gt)        # create tables
library(tidyverse) # collection of R packages designed for data science

library(janitor)
```

> As a reminder, if a function does not work and you receive an error like this: `could not find function "random_function"`; or if you try to load a package and you receive an error like this: `` there is no package called `random_package` `` , then you will need to install the package using `install.packages("random_package")` in the console (the bottom-left window in R studio).

> Once you have installed the package you will *never* need to install it again, however you must *always* load in the packages at the beginning of your R markdown using `library(random_package)`, as shown in this document.

> The style of code and package we will be using is called [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/). Most functions we use for data manipulation are available within the `tidyverse` package and if not, I've indicated the packages used in the code chunk above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PART 3: Explore the data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 4: Read in data

To demonstrate mixture modeling in the training program of the NSF grant we utilize the *Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY)* data repository.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

var_table <- tribble(
   ~"Name",      ~"Label",  ~"Values",                                   
#--------------|--------------------------------|-----|,
  "Enjoy",   "I enjoy science "                   ,  "0 = Disagree, 1 = Agree",
  "Useful",  "Science useful in everday problems ",  "0 = Disagree, 1 = Agree",
  "Logical", "Science helps logical thinkng "     ,  "0 = Disagree, 1 = Agree",
  "Job",     "Need science for a good job "       ,  "0 = Disagree, 1 = Agree",
  "Adult",   "Will use science often as an adult ",  "0 = Disagree, 1 = Agree",
  "Female",   "Reported gender"                   ,  "0 = Male, 1 = Female")

gt(var_table) %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = "",  # Add a title
    subtitle = md("&nbsp;")) %>% 
  tab_options(
    table.width = pct(80),
    column_labels.font.weight = "bold"
  ) 

```

**To read in data in R:**
```{r}
data <- read_csv(here("data", "lca_lsay_sci.csv"),
                      na = c("9999", "9999.00")) %>%               
  clean_names() %>%                                                                        
  dplyr::select(1:5, Female=female, Enjoy = ab39m, Useful = ab39t,                                              Logical = ab39u, Job = ab39w, Adult = ab39x)
```

```{r}
# Save clean data
write_csv(data, here("data", "lsay_sci_data.csv"))
```

**View data in R:**
```{r}

# 1. click on the data in your Global Environment (upper right pane) or use...
View(data)
# 2. summary() gives basic summary statistics & shows number of NA values
# *great for checking that data has been read in correctly*
summary(data)
# 3. names() provides a list of column names. Very useful if you don't have them memorized!
names(data)
# 4. head() prints the top x rows of the dataframe
head(data)
```

### Step 5: Descriptive Statistics

Let's look at descriptive statistics for each variable.
Because looking at the ID variables' (`leaid`) and (`necessch`) descriptives is unnecessary, we use `select()` to remove the variable by using the minus (`-`) sign:

```{r}
data %>% 
  select(-Female) %>% 
  summary()
```

Alternatively, we can use the `psych::describe()` function to give more information:

```{r}
data %>% 
  select(-Female) %>% 
  describe()
```

What if we want to look at a subset of the data?
For example, what if we want to subset the data to observe a specific school district? (`leaid`)
We can use `tidyverse::filter()` to subset the data using certain criteria.

```{r}
data %>% 
  filter(Female == 1) %>% 
  describe() 


#You can use any operator to filter: >, <, ==, >=, etc.
```


Since we have binary data (e.g., 0s & 1s), it would be helpful to look at the proportions:

```{r}
data %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  pivot_longer(Enjoy:Adult, names_to = "variable") %>% 
  group_by(variable) %>% 
  summarise(prop = sum(value)/n(),
            n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(prop))
```
